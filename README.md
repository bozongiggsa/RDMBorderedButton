#RDMBorderedButton

A subclass of UIButton that adds a border.

##Usage

In code: Use initWithFrame to create a button and add to a subview.

Interface Builder: Add a button as usual. Set the class to RDMBorderedButton â€” there are some bugs with iOS 7.1 that require you to set the buttom type to Custom in Interface Builder. Also note that you can use the "User Defined Runtime Attributes" in Interface Builder to set the corner radius (key: "cornerRadius"). The example project shows this with the black and yellow buttons.

###Corner Radius

By default, RDMBorderedButton will adjusts the corner radius of its border based on its frame. You can turn this off with:

	button.adjustsCornerRadiusBasedOnFrame = NO; //Default is YES
	
You can also change the ratio of the corner radius off this automatic adjustment:

	button.cornerRadiusRatioToSmallestSide = 1.0/4.0; //Default is 1.0/6.0
	
The corner radius can be adjusted manually (this turns off automatic adjustments):

	button.cornerRadius = 6.0;
	
###Color

The text and border color are adjusted together. For normal state they can be changed using either:

	button.tintColor = [UIColor greenColor];
	
or:

	[button setTitleColor:[UIColor greenColor] forState:UIControlStateNormal]; 

Disabled state can be adjusted using:

	[button setTitleColor:[UIColor grayColor] forState:UIControlStateDisabled]; //Default is [UIColor grayColor]
	
The text color when highlighted should be changed using:

	[self setTitleColor:[UIColor blueColor] forState:UIControlStateHighlighted]; //Default is [UIColor whiteColor]
